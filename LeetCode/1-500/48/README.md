# LeetCode #48

## Rotate an Image

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by **90** degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image **in-place**, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

## Example 1

![matrix 1](./mat1.jpg)]

**Input:** matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

**Output:** [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

## Example 2

![matrix 2](./mat2.jpg)

**Input:** matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]

**Output:** [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]

## Example 3

**Input:** matrix = [[1]]

**Output:** [[1]]

## Example 4

**Input:** matrix = [[1,2],[3,4]]

**Output:** [[3,1],[4,2]]

## Constraints:

- matrix.length == n
- matrix[i].length == n
- 1 <= n <= 20
- -1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000

## Personal Reflection

I originally saw this problem while taking a coding assessment for Capital One on the Code Signal platform. I found it interesting, as I can see the practicality of the problem, and I intuitively knew the solution was simple, you just had to know the trick. I tried the problem for close to half an hour until the assesment was up with no progress on a solution. I looked up the solution the next day and knew this was a problem I had to study.

While practicing the LeetCode Top Interview Questions, this problem came up again. I was excited because I had seen this problem before in the wild. While I studied this problem a little, I had not studied it enough to get it. I continued to study and practice the problem intermitently.

Today, I was able to solve the problem and satisfy myself. I was able to visualize the problem and solution, and solve it in a timely manner with no errors. I also hadn't looked at the problem in 2 or 3 weeks so it wasn't fresh in my mind.

I enjoyed the process to solve this problem and I look forward to revisiting it.
